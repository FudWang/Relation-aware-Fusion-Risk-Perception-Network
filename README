## 🧩 Overview
This repository contains the implementation of **RFRP-Net (Relation-aware Fusion Risk Perception Network)** —  
a deep learning framework for **dynamic supply chain risk prediction and anomaly detection**.

RFRP-Net integrates:
- A **Relation-Aware Graph Convolutional Network (RA-GCN)** for heterogeneous structural modeling.
- An **Attention-based Abnormality Detection Feature Fusion (AADFF)** mechanism for anomaly perception.

> 📄 This repository accompanies the paper:  
> *“Relation-aware Fusion Risk Perception Network for Dynamic Risk Analysis and Anomaly Detection in Supply Chain Networks”*

## 🚧 Project Status
🛠️ **Code and dataset are currently being organized.**  
The repository will soon include:
- Full implementation of RFRP-Net  
- Data preprocessing pipeline for the DataCo Global dataset  
- Training and evaluation scripts  
- Visualization and analysis tools  

Stay tuned — the initial release is expected soon.

## 🔍 Model Architecture
RFRP-Net consists of two major components:

1. **Relation-Aware Graph Convolutional Network (RA-GCN)**  
   Captures heterogeneous relationships among customers, orders, and products using multi-granularity attention guided by business similarity and risk intensity.

2. **Attention-based Abnormality Detection Feature Fusion (AADFF)**  
   Enhances weak anomaly detection through sparsity- and deviation-constrained query vectors, Bi-LSTM encoding, and attention entropy metrics.

## 🗂️ Dataset
Experiments are based on the **DataCo Global Supply Chain Dataset**, which includes operational data from supply, production, sales, and distribution stages.  
Due to licensing and size constraints, the dataset is **not included** here.  
You can download it from Figshare:  
🔗 [https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.28714328](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.28714328)

### Data Preprocessing (to be released)
The preprocessing script will:
- Construct a dynamic heterogeneous graph  
- Apply **Min–Max normalization** to numerical features  
- Perform **One-hot encoding** on categorical features  
- Generate **temporal snapshots** for dynamic modeling
